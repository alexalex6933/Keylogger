# Keylogger
Educational keylogger research project exploring keylogging techniques, stealth methods, persistence, and data exfiltration using Python and C++. Developed for understanding attacker methodologies to enhance defensive security. For educational purposes only. Tested in a controlled environment.

The link below provides a detailed overview of the design decisions made throughout the development of the keylogger project. It includes explanations of the code, insights into the choices behind implementation strategies, and an analysis of the techniques used to achieve stealth, persistence, and data exfiltration.
